=== Porting Existing Code to Connect to a Web Service Instead of a Database

==== Starting Command Line Client

One of the benefits of ROP is that the client code is no different from the server code - it uses the same
ObjectContext interface for access, same query and commit API. So the code below will be similar to the code
presented in the first Cayenne Getting Started Guide, although with a few ROP-specific parts required
to bootstrap the ObjectContext.

Let's start by creating an empty Main class with the standard main() method in the client project:

[source, java]
----
package org.example.cayenne.persistent.client;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
----

Now the part that is actually different from regular Cayenne - establishing the server connection and
obtaining the ObjectContext:

[source, java]
----
Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<>();
properties.put(ClientConstants.ROP_SERVICE_URL_PROPERTY, "http://localhost:8080/cayenne-service");
properties.put(ClientConstants.ROP_SERVICE_USERNAME_PROPERTY, "cayenne-user");
properties.put(ClientConstants.ROP_SERVICE_PASSWORD_PROPERTY, "secret");
properties.put(ClientConstants.ROP_SERVICE_REALM_PROPERTY, "Cayenne Realm");


ClientRuntime runtime = ClientRuntime.builder()
                        .properties(properties)
                        .addModule(new ClientJettyHttpModule())
                        .build();
ObjectContext context = runtime.newContext();
----

Note that the "runtime" can be used to create as many peer ObjectContexts as needed over the same connection,
while ObjectContext is a kind of isolated "persistence session", similar to the server-side context. A few more notes.
Since we are using HTTP(S) to communicate with ROP server, there's no need to explicitly close the connection
(or channel, or context).

So now let's do the same persistent operaions that we did in the first tutorial "Main" class. Let's start by
creating and saving some objects:

[source, java]
----
// creating new Artist
Artist picasso = context.newObject(Artist.class);
picasso.setName("Pablo Picasso");

// Creating other objects
Gallery metropolitan = context.newObject(Gallery.class);
metropolitan.setName("Metropolitan Museum of Art");

Painting girl = context.newObject(Painting.class);
girl.setName("Girl Reading at a Table");

Painting stein = context.newObject(Painting.class);
stein.setName("Gertrude Stein");

// connecting objects together via relationships
picasso.addToPaintings(girl);
picasso.addToPaintings(stein);

girl.setGallery(metropolitan);
stein.setGallery(metropolitan);

// saving all the changes above
context.commitChanges();
----

Now let's select them back:

[source, java]
----
// ObjectSelect examples
List<Painting> paintings1 = ObjectSelect.query(Painting.class).select(context);

List<Painting> paintings2 = ObjectSelect.query(Painting.class)
        .where(Painting.NAME.likeIgnoreCase("gi%")).select(context);
----

Now, delete:

[source, java]
----
// Delete object example
Artist picasso = ObjectSelect.query(Artist.class).where(Artist.NAME.eq("Pablo Picasso")).selectOne(context);

if (picasso != null) {
    context.deleteObject(picasso);
    context.commitChanges();
}
----

This code is exactly the same as in the first tutorial. So now let's try running the client and see what happens.
In Eclipse open main class and select "Run > Run As > Java Application" from the menu (assuming the ROP server
started in the previous step is still running). You will some output in both server and client process consoles. Client:

----

----

As you see client prints no SQL statmenets, just a bunch of query and flush messages sent to the server.
The server side is more verbose, showing the actual client queries executed against the database:

----

INFO: SELECT NEXT_ID FROM AUTO_PK_SUPPORT WHERE TABLE_NAME = ? FOR UPDATE [bind: 1:'GALLERY']

You are done with the basic ROP client!
