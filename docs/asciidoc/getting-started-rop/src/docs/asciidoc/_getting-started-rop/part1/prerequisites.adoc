=== Prerequisites

This tutorial starts where "Getting Started with Cayenne" left off. If you have gone through the previous tutorial, and have the "tutorial" project open in Eclipse, you can go directly to the next step. If not, here are the compressed instructions to prepare you for work with ROP:

* Step 1 - Eclipse Setup
* Step 2 - Create a project
* Step 3 - Create Cayenne OR Mapping
* Step 4 - Create Java Classes
* Step 5 - Convert the project to webapp.

Note that at "Step 5" you can skip the JSP creation part. Just setup web.xml and maven-jetty-plugin in the POM.
