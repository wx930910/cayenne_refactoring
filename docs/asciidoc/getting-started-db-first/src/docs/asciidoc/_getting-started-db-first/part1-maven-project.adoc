=== Maven Project

The goal of this chapter is to create a new Java project in IntelliJ IDEA and to setup Maven Cayenne plugin

==== Create a new Project in IntelliJ IDEA

In IntelliJ IDEA select `File > New > Project...` and then select "Maven" and click "Next".
In the dialog shown on the screenshot below, fill the "Group Id" and "Artifact Id" fields and click "Next".

On next dialog screen you can customize directory for your project and click "Finish".
Now you should have a new empty project.

==== Plugin setup

Next step is setting up Cayenne plugin in `pom.xml` file.
For the convenience let's define Cayenne version that we will use across project file: 
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<properties>
    <cayenne.version>{project-version}</cayenne.version>
</properties>
----

Next step is to include plugin.
Here is code snippet that enable `cayenne-maven-plugin` in our demo project: 
[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.cayenne.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>cayenne-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${cayenne.version}</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----
