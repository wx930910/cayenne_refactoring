=== Selecting Objects
This chapter shows how to select objects from the database using `ObjectSelect` query. 
    
==== Introducing ObjectSelect
It was shown before how to persist new objects. Cayenne queries are used to access
already saved objects. The primary query type used for selecting objects is `ObjectSelect`.
It can be mapped in CayenneModeler or created
via the API. We'll use the latter approach in this section. We don't have too much data
in the database yet, but we can still demonstrate the main principles below.

- Select all paintings (the code, and the log output it generates):

[source,java]
----
List<Painting> paintings1 = ObjectSelect.query(Painting.class).select(context);
----

   INFO: SELECT t0.GALLERY_ID, t0.ARTIST_ID, t0.NAME, t0.ID FROM PAINTING t0
   INFO: === returned 2 rows. - took 18 ms.

- Select paintings that start with "`gi`", ignoring case:

[source,java]
----
List<Painting> paintings2 = ObjectSelect.query(Painting.class)
        .where(Painting.NAME.likeIgnoreCase("gi%")).select(context);
----
    INFO: SELECT t0.GALLERY_ID, t0.NAME, t0.ARTIST_ID, t0.ID FROM PAINTING t0 WHERE UPPER(t0.NAME) LIKE UPPER(?)
      [bind: 1->NAME:'gi%'] - prepared in 6 ms.
    INFO: === returned 1 row. - took 18 ms.

- Select all paintings done by artists who were born more than a 100 years ago:

[source,java]
----
List<Painting> paintings3 = ObjectSelect.query(Painting.class)
        .where(Painting.ARTIST.dot(Artist.DATE_OF_BIRTH).lt(LocalDate.of(1900,1,1)))
        .select(context);
----

    INFO: SELECT t0.GALLERY_ID, t0.NAME, t0.ARTIST_ID, t0.ID FROM PAINTING t0 JOIN ARTIST t1 ON (t0.ARTIST_ID = t1.ID)
      WHERE t1.DATE_OF_BIRTH < ? [bind: 1->DATE_OF_BIRTH:'1911-01-01 00:00:00.493'] - prepared in 7 ms.
    INFO: === returned 2 rows. - took 25 ms.
