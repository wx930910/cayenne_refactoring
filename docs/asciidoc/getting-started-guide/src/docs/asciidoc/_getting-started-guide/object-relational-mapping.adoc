=== Getting started with Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
The goal of this section is to learn how to create a simple Object-Relational model with
CayenneModeler. We will create a complete ORM model for the following database
schema:

NOTE: Very often you'd have an existing database already, and
    it can be quickly imported in Cayenne via "Tools &gt; Reengineer Database
    Schema". This will save you lots of time compared to manual mapping. However
    understanding how to create the mapping by hand is important, so we are showing
    the "manual" approach below.

==== Mapping Database Tables and Columns
Lets go back to CayenneModeler where we have the newly created project open and start
by adding the ARTIST table. Database tables are called *DbEntities*
in Cayenne mapping (those can be actual tables or database views).

Select "datamap" on the left-hand side project tree and click "Create DbEntity" button image:icon-dbentity.png[]
(or use "Project &gt; Create DbEntity" menu). A new DbEntity is created. In "DbEntity
Name" field enter "ARTIST". Then click on "Create Attribute" button image:icon-attribute.png[]
on the entity toolbar. This action changes the view to the "Attribute"
tab and adds a new attribute (attribute means a "table column" in this case) called
"untitledAttr". Let's rename it to ID, make it an `INTEGER` and make it a PK:

image::modeler-artistid.png[align="center"]

Similarly add NAME `VARCHAR(200)` and DATE_OF_BIRTH `DATE` attributes. After that repeat
this procedure for PAINTING and GALLERY entities to match DB schema shown above.

==== Mapping Database Relationships

Now we need to specify relationships between ARTIST, PAINTING and GALLERY tables.
Start by creating a one-to-many ARTIST/PAINTING relationship:

- Select the ARTIST DbEntity on the left and click on the "Properties" tab.

- Click on "Create Relationship" button on the entity toolbar image:icon-relationship.png[] - relationship
configuration dialog is presented.

- Choose the "Target" to be "Painting".

- Assign names for relationship and reverse relationship. This name can be
anything (this is really a symbolic name of the database referential
constraint), but it is recommended to use a valid Java identifier, as this will
save some typing later. We'll call the relationship "paintings" and reverse
relationship "artist".

- Check "ToMany" checkbox for "paintings" relationship

- Click on "Add" button on the right to add a join

- Select "ID" column for the "Source" and "ARTIST_ID" column for the target.

- Relationship information should now look like this:

image::modeler-dbrelationship.png[align="center"]

- Click "Done" to confirm the changes and close the dialog.

- Two complimentary relationships have been created - from ARTIST to PAINTING
and back.

- Repeat the steps above to create a many-to-one relationship from PAINTING to GALLERY, calling the relationships pair
"gallery" and "paintings".

==== Mapping Java Classes

Now that the database schema mapping is complete, CayenneModeler can create mappings
of Java classes (aka "ObjEntities") by deriving everything from DbEntities. At present
there is no way to do it for the entire DataMap in one click, so we'll do it for each
table individually.

- Select "ARTIST" DbEntity and click on "Create ObjEntity" button image:icon-new_objentity.png[]
either on the entity toolbar or on the main toolbar. An ObjEntity called
"Artist" is created with a Java class field set to
`org.example.cayenne.persistent.Artist`. The modeler transformed the database
names to the Java-friendly names (e.g., if you click on the "Attributes" tab,
you'll see that "DATE_OF_BIRTH" column was converted to "dateOfBirth" Java class
attribute).

- Select "GALLERY" DbEntity and click on "Create ObjEntity" button again - you'll see a "Gallery" ObjEntity created.
- Finally, do the same thing for "PAINTING".

Now you need to synchronize relationships. Artist and Gallery entities were created
when there was no related "Painting" entity, so their relationships were not set.

- Click on the "Artist" ObjEntity. Now click on "Sync ObjEntity with DbEntity" button on
the toolbar image:icon-sync.png[] - you will see the "paintings" relationship appear.
- Do the same for the "Gallery" entity.

Unless you want to customize the Java class and property names (which you can do easily) the mapping is complete.
