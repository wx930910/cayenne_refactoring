=== Queries

Queries are Java objects used by the application to communicate with the database.
Cayenne knows how to translate queries into SQL statements appropriate for a particular database engine.
Most often queries are used to find objects matching certain criteria, but there are other types of queries too.
E.g. those allowing to run native SQL, call DB stored procedures, etc. When committing objects,
Cayenne itself creates special queries to insert/update/delete rows in the database.

There is a number of built-in queries in Cayenne, described later in this chapter.
Most of the newer queries use fluent API and can be created and executed as easy-to-read one-liners.
Users can define their own query types to abstract certain DB interactions
that for whatever reason can not be adequately described by the built-in set.

Queries can be roughly categorized as "object" and "native".
Object queries (most notably `ObjectSelect`, `SelectById`, and `EJBQLQuery`)
are built with abstractions originating in the object model (the "object" side in the "object-relational" divide).
E.g. `ObjectSelect` consists of a Java class of objects to fetch, a qualifier expression, orderings, etc. - all of this
expressed in terms of the object model.

Native queries describe a desired DB operation using SQL (`SQLSelect`, `SQLExec` query), a reference to a stored
procedure (`ProcedureQuery`), etc. The results of native queries are lists of scalars, lists of `Object[]` or lists of
maps (a term "data row" is often used to describe such a map). Some of them can potentially be converted to persistent
objects (though usually with considerable effort). Native queries are less (if at all) portable across databases
than object queries.
