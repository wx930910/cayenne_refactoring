==== SQLSelect and SQLExec

SQL is very powerful and allows to manipulate data in ways that can not always be described as a graph of related entities.
Cayenne acknowledges this fact and provides a facility to execute SQL, sometimes allowing to map results back to
persistent objects. `SQLSelect` and `SQLExec` are a pair of queries that allow to run native SQL. `SQLSelect` can be
used (as the name suggests) to select custom data in form of entities, separate columns, collection of `DataRow` or
`Object[]`. `SQLExec` is designed to execute any SQL (e.g. updates, deletes, DDLs, etc.).

Both queries support advanced SQL templating, with variable substitution and special directives as described
<<sqlscripting,in the next chapter>>. Here we'll just provide a few simple examples:

[source, java]
----
// Selecting objects
List<Painting> paintings = SQLSelect
    .query(Painting.class, "SELECT * FROM PAINTING WHERE PAINTING_TITLE LIKE 'A%'")
    .upperColumnNames()
    .localCache()
    .limit(100)
    .select(context);

// Selecting scalar values
List<String> paintingNames = SQLSelect
    .scalarQuery(String.class, "SELECT PAINTING_TITLE FROM PAINTING WHERE ESTIMATED_PRICE > 100000")
    .select(context);

// Selecting DataRow with predefined types
List<DataRow> result = SQLSelect
    .dataRowQuery("SELECT * FROM ARTIST", Integer.class, String.class, LocalDate.class)
    .select(context);

// Selecting Object[] with predefined types
List<Object[]> result = SQLSelect
    .scalarQuery("SELECT * FROM ARTIST", Integer.class, String.class, LocalDate.class)
    .select(context);
----

And here is an example of how to use `SQLExec`:

[source, java]
----
int inserted = SQLExec
    .query("INSERT INTO ARTIST (ARTIST_ID, ARTIST_NAME) VALUES (55, 'Picasso')")
    .update(context);
