==== ProcedureCall

Stored procedures are mapped as separate objects in CayenneModeler.
`ProcedureCall` provides a way to execute them with a certain set of parameters.
This query is a "fluent" version of older `ProcedureQuery`. Just like with `SQLTemplate`,
the outcome of a procedure can be anything - a single result set, multiple result sets,
some data modification (returned as an update count), or a combination of these.
So use root class to get a single result set, and use only procedure name for anything else:


[source, java]
----
List<Artist> result = ProcedureCall.query("my_procedure", Artist.class)
    .param("p1", "abc")
    .param("p2", 3000)
    .call(context)
    .firstList();
----

[source, java]
----
// here we do not bother with root class.
// Procedure name gives us needed routing information
ProcedureResult result = ProcedureCall.query("my_procedure")
    .param("p1", "abc")
    .param("p2", 3000)
    .call();
----

A stored procedure can return data back to the application as result sets or via OUT parameters.
To simplify the processing of the query output, QueryResponse treats OUT parameters as if it was a separate result set.
For stored procedures declaref any OUT or INOUT parameters, `ProcedureResult` have convenient utility method to get them:

[source, java]
----
ProcedureResult result = ProcedureCall.query("my_procedure")
    .call(context);

// read OUT parameters
Object out = result.getOutParam("out_param");
----

There maybe a situation when a stored procedure handles its own transactions,
but an application is configured to use Cayenne-managed transactions.
This is obviously conflicting and undesirable behavior.
In this case ProcedureQueries should be executed explicitly wrapped in an "external" Transaction.
This is one of the few cases when a user should worry about transactions at all.
See Transactions section for more details.
