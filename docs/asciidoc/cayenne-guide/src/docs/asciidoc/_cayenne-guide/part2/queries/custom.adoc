==== Custom Queries

If a user needs some extra functionality not addressed by the existing set of Cayenne queries, he can write his own.
The only requirement is to implement `org.apache.cayenne.query.Query` interface.
The easiest way to go about it is to subclass some of the base queries in Cayenne.

E.g. to do something directly in the JDBC layer, you might subclass `AbstractQuery`:

[source, java]
----
public class MyQuery extends AbstractQuery {

    @Override
    public SQLAction createSQLAction(SQLActionVisitor visitor) {
        return new SQLAction() {

            @Override
            public void performAction(Connection connection, OperationObserver observer) throws SQLException, Exception {
                // 1. do some JDBC work using provided connection...
                // 2. push results back to Cayenne via OperationObserver
            }
        };
    }
}
----

To delegate the actual query execution to a standard Cayenne query, you may subclass `IndirectQuery`:


[source, java]
----
public class MyDelegatingQuery extends IndirectQuery {

    @Override
    protected Query createReplacementQuery(EntityResolver resolver) {
        SQLTemplate delegate = new SQLTemplate(SomeClass.class, generateRawSQL());
        delegate.setFetchingDataRows(true);
        return delegate;
    }

    protected String generateRawSQL() {
        // build some SQL string
    }
}
----

In fact many internal Cayenne queries are `IndirectQueries`, delegating to `SelectQuery` or `SQLTemplate`
after some preprocessing.
