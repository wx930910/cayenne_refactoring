==== MappedSelect and MappedExec

`MappedSelect` and `MappedExec` is a queries that are just a reference to another queries stored in the DataMap.
The actual stored query can be SelectQuery, SQLTemplate, EJBQLQuery, etc.
Difference between `MappedSelect` and `MappedExec` is (as reflected in their names) whether underlying query
intended to select data or just to perform some generic SQL code.

NOTE: These queries are "fluent" versions of deprecated `NamedQuery` class.

Here is example of how to use `MappedSelect`:

[source, java]
----
List<Artist> results = MappedSelect.query("artistsByName", Artist.class) 
    .param("name", "Picasso") 
    .select(context);
----

And here is example of `MappedExec`:

[source, java]
----
QueryResult result = MappedExec.query("updateQuery") 
    .param("var", "value") 
    .execute(context);
System.out.println("Rows updated: " + result.firstUpdateCount());
----
